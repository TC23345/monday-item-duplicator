# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

Welcome! Your Monday.com Item Duplicator with **Duplicate Detection** is ready to go with UV (super fast!).

## âœ¨ What's New: Duplicate Detection!

The script now **automatically checks for duplicates**:
- If an item with the same name exists in the destination â†’ **Updates it**
- If no duplicate found â†’ **Creates new item**

This means you can run the script multiple times safely - it won't create duplicates! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Mode

When you run `run.bat`, you'll see:

```
Enter item name to duplicate (or press Enter for ALL items):
```

**Option 1: Single Item**
- Type: `Who Qualifies to File a Roblox Child Predator Lawsuit Claim?`
- Press Enter
- Script checks if it exists in destination
- **If exists**: Updates it with latest data
- **If not**: Creates new item

**Option 2: Batch Mode (All Items)**
- Just press Enter (leave blank)
- ALL items from the source group will be processed
- Each item is checked for duplicates
- Existing items are updated, new ones are created

---

## ðŸ”§ What Gets Processed

The script will map these 6 fields:

1. **Name** (the item title)
2. **Focus Keyword**
3. **Meta Title**
4. **Surfer Editor Link** (with URL as display text)
5. **Surfer Page ID**
6. **Client Pillars** (board relation)

**With duplicate detection**, you'll see:
- âœ… "Item created" for new items
- ðŸ”„ "Item updated" for existing items

## ðŸ’¡ Why UV?

UV is a blazingly fast Python package manager (10-100x faster than pip!):
- Written in Rust for maximum performance
- Drop-in replacement for pip
- Better dependency resolution
- Works with existing requirements.txt

---

## ðŸŽ­ How Duplicate Detection Works

```
1. Script finds item in source board
2. Checks if item with same name exists in destination
3a. IF EXISTS â†’ Updates existing item with new data âœ…
3b. IF NOT EXISTS â†’ Creates new item âœ…
4. Shows clear action taken (CREATED or UPDATED)
```

**Benefits:**
- Run the script as many times as you want
- No duplicate items cluttering your board
- Always have the latest data from source
- Clear summary of what was created vs updated

---

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

**"UV not found"**
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**"MONDAY_API_KEY not found"**
- Check that `.env` file exists
- Verify it contains: `MONDAY_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**"Item not found"**
- Check the item name is exactly correct (case-sensitive)
- Verify it exists in the source board

**"Duplicate not detected when it should be"**
- Item names must match **exactly** (including case, spaces, punctuation)
- Check both boards to verify the names match

Happy duplicating (without the duplicates)! ðŸŽ¯
